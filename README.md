* [C Program to reverse the elements(half-half) of an array](https://github.com/darsigangothri06/mycprograms/blob/main/arrayrever.c)<br>
<b>Sample I/O:</b> <br>
				Input: 1 2 3 4 5 <br>
				Output:  2 1 3 5 4<br>
				using dynamic memory allocation
* [Eliminate duplicates in two arrays](https://github.com/darsigangothri06/mycprograms/blob/main/arraysortdup_new.c)<br>
You are given two integer arrays A and B. Write a program to create an array D that contains integers from A and B. <br>
		**Note: The Array should not contain duplicates and the elements are to be sorted.** <br>
		<b>Sample I/O:</b> <br>
		Input:  [3,3,3,4],[5,6,6,7,9,2]<br>
		Output: [2,3,4,5,6,7,9]<br>
